# HopBox
 An image analysis pipeline for evaluating hop cone morphology in the context of breeding programs. In this analysis we use a fully convolutional network trained using 12 manually masked images. This work has been submitted to the Plant Phenome Journal.

## This respository contains: 

### data
image weights, and some examples of raw images to test the pipeline

### output
all output produced by the pipeline

### resources
materials list and instructions for making your own hop box using readily available materials

### scripts
google colab code including the cone detection, color correction, barcode reading, and data output pipeline, r code for analyzing the data, running analyses of variance, calculating heritability, creating figures, and optimizing cone sample numbers
