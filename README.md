# HopBox
 An image analysis pipeline for evaluating hop cone morphology in the context of breeding programs. In this analysis we use a fully convolutional network trained using 12 manually masked images. This work has been submitted to the Plant Phenome Journal.

## This respository contains: 

### Data
image weights, dry matter data

### Output
all output produced by the pipeline

### Resources
materials list and instructions for making your own hop box using readily available materials

### Scripts
google colab code for cone detection (please read the README), color correction, barcode reading, and data output pipeline, as well as various r scripts for analyzing the data, running analyses of variance, calculating heritability, creating figures, and optimizing cone sample numbers.

### Additional Online Resources
